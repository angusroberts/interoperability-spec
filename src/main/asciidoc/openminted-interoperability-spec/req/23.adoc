IMPORTANT: This requirement has been deprecated because it is considered to be a functional requirement of the workflow manager rather than an interoperability requirement. 

A workflow must aggregate all licences either from the components which is composed of, or from the language resources/knowledge bases that are used withing it and inform the user about them.
(Requirement extracted from Interoperability scenario WG3-2)

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.
