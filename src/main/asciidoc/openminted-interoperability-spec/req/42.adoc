The metadata can include the information on which projects/workflows involve the resource, thus allowing to state resource "popularity", increase reliablility, bring TDM outputs to a better interoperability. 

Note: For use inside OMTD, this can be moved to the platform functions; for use out of OMTD, this can be left to the providers/users, so we can at best recommend it. This information can be used for evaluation purposes.
