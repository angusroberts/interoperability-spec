The OMTD-SHARE metadata schema includes the element _componentType_ which can be used for classifying components with values taken from a controlled vocabulary created in the OpenMinTeD project (implemented in SKOS: _pending link_). Each component can be assigned multiple values, allowing for multiple classification. The current set of values focuses on terms used by NLP and TDM experts, but it will be extended to include terms for non-expert users.
