It should be possible to trace back which component produced an annotation element or assigned a category and which knowledge resources may have been involved in the process. This does not entail that every annotation element must have explicit provenance metadata. The requirement could also be solved by assuming that all annotations of a certain type or within a certain view were created by one component and providing just provenance at the level of the type or view.

The ability to trace back could e.g. be relevant in order to perform a post-hoc linking/disambiguation of categories obtained from different knowledge resources or to adjust/harmonize relevance/confidence scores based on different scales.

NOTE: DKPro Core includes tagset information into the annotated document (in most cases even for tags that were not seen, but present in the model). U-Compare had strong support for provenance. Some annotation schemes have support for relevance/confidence scores, but others do not.

| Alvis
| 0.5rc
| Partial
| The creator of an annotation is identified but no trace about the involved resources or annotation categories.

| ARGO
| 0.5
| No
| There is no information output from an execution that identifies which components produced individual annotations.
| Draft

| DKPro Core
| 1.8.0
| Partial
| Most DKPro Core components add tagset information. This mechanism currently assumes that only a single component in a workflow creates annotations of a given layer (i.e., the information is maintained at the level of layers, not at the level of individual annotations). Further, the mechanism requires that the tagset information can actually be extracted from the model being used.

| Partial
| Some existing components (specifically the JAPE transducer) add information to annotations about what created them, but currently this isn't standard across all components, although I think I can see a way of doing so.

| No
| No relevant annotation added.
