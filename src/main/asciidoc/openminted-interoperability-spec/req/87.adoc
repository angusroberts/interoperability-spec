This requirement can be fulfilled with implementation of requirement 75. However, it is common that components take a
model as input parameter (for instance in the case of DKPro Core) and hence the languages supported by the component
are determined by the available models. In such cases language information can not be encoded in the component metadata.
One option is to implement a functionality in the registry to look up available models for each component and update
the component language capabilities based on the modelâ€™s language. This function can be triggered every time a new
model is added to the registry.

| Most DKPro Core components take a model as a parameter. The model then usually determines the language. Also for
components that are locked to a specific language, this information is currently not included in the component metadata.
