To keep product and documentation in sync, It is a good practice to version documentation along with the source with
identical versions. This means that documentation should reside inside the source as a dedicated module (e.g. for
softwareX there could be softwareX-documentation module) with the same version identifier. Every time a new release of
the software is published, its corresponding documentation accompanies it. This guarantees that source and
documentation are always kept in sync.
