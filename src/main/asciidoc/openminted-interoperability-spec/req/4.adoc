The URL of the actual content, e.g. a text file, PDF file, or other common data format, must be
derivable from readily discoverable data. It must either be included in the metadata or it must
be reliably constructable from the metadata URL, e.g. by appending or changing a suffix. Derivation
rules must be clearly documented.

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.

| Draft

| OpenAIRE
|
| Partial
| There's a link to the doi but not always; and usually the doi sends to a landing page, but there are some rules that can be used for "guessing" the download link
