If you want to work with a KR its relevant elements need to be added as text metadata. This enables the TDM modules to work in a uniform manner with the informational content the KRs provide. In order to obtain annotations you need to follow KR access routines such as XPATH/ontology based and gazetteer based lookup, and existing APIs/web services.

This is a methodological requirement an as such not suited for the compliance check.
