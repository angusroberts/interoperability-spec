* <<REQ-13>>

It is customary to ask for scholarly attribution when a component is used through citation of a specific publication. 
The OMTD-SHARE metadata schema includes a specific metadata element for this, namely "mustBeCitedWith", which is recommended and can be filled in either with the identifier of a publication (_publicationIdentifier_) or with a free text field (_documentUnstructured_).
The preferred option is adding the identifier of the publication.

|publicationIdentifier

|mandatory (choice with documentUnstructured)

|Reference to the publication scheme that has been used for the identifier (e.g. DOI, handle, arXiv, bibcode etc.); the list of values includes the most widespread schemes used for publications

|schemeURI
|attribute

According to REQ-2, this information should be provided in the component metadata. The recommended way to do this is by adding Java annotations in the GATE and UIMA descriptors specific to this element.

NOTE: discuss how to do this
