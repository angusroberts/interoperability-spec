=== Scenario 2 -- Focus on TDM tools and TDM services

==== Description

The same scenario as scenario 1 above applies, however database (Y) is not directly accessible. On the contrary, the
database owner allows the user (on the basis of the academic subscription) to run the rights holder dedicated TDM web
service. Basically, the researcher does not have direct access to the database, but he is only able to place a query and
obtain a result. The TDM web service is made available to the researcher for “non commercial uses” only. On the other
hand, database Z is directly accessed but using the software (freely downloadable) of Company Alfa. The licence of
software Alfa allows users to use the software only for non commercial purposes. For the purpose of this scenario,
database Y and Z are not protected by any IP rights nor their use is contractually restricted, i.e. they are in the
public domain (i.e. the scope of the question is to test the enforceability of services’ and tools’ agreements in
relation to the results of the TDM activity). 

The results of the TDM so obtained are all combined together in one new DB. Can the researcher publish a paper based on
those results? Can he publish the paper under a CC-BY 4.0  license. Can he also publish the DB itself under a CC-BY 4.0 license? If yes, is he bound to apply a NC licence? Can the
researcher develop a commercial product and sell it? Would the fact that the “results” reproduce substantial or
insubstantial parts of the original DB, or on the contrary that those results do not reproduce parts of the original
DB (for example the statistical recurrence of a given word in the DBs, but not the word itself) make a difference in
the result?

==== Relevance to the WG

The scenario adds a main element of complexity: some TDM services restrict the use that you can do with the results
obtained from their services. In this case researchers are not directly accessing a database but they are using a service
offered by the data provider to analyse its own DB. Of particular relevance when the DB is not protected by copyright
or sui generis database rights (SGDR ) and therefore the SLA (service level agreement) is the only basis to restrict
use of the results (not backed-up by property rights).

==== Relevance to other WGs

* WG 1 - Are the licences or rights statement expressed in DB metadata? How to identify this license in case of services?
* WG 2 - N/A
* WG 4 - License information and provenance information must be preserved throughout the workflow.

==== Relevance in general

External experts combine expertise in the legal and technical field. The combination of the DB legal conditions and the
add-on of the service element an additional step toward the determination of legal interoperability.

==== Approaches

* Correct labeling of the resources with information about the licence, and with relevant licence metadata. With proper
labeling, through the correct application of the licence and licence metadata, a first set of problems can be solved.
* Correct use of licences. The convergence towards a de facto standard (e.g. CC variants) will reduce incompatibility
issues and transaction costs.
* ELC: proper exception to copyright and related rights (e.g. UK to some extent) can contribute to fix additional access
and reuse issues.
