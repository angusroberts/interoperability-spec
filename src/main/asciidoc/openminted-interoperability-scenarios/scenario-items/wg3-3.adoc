=== Scenario 3 -- The type and nature of TDM results (or How far do copyright and SGDR reach)?

==== Description

The same scenario as scenario 1 above applies. Would it make any difference if the resulting DB, although being based
on the data of the original databases, does not reproduce any substantial or insubstantial parts of those databases?
In other words, the results of TDM are directly based on the analysis of the original DBs but do not materially
reproduce any part of them? For example the results of the TDM activity is "in the analysed corpora the word "and"
occurs 235 times". 

==== Relevance to the WG

The scenario looks into the scope of copyright and SGDR protection. To what extent a DB that "derives" from another
one, without however reproducing it, can be considered a derivative of the originals, under both copyright rules and
SGDR rules? 

==== Relevance to other WGs

* WG 1 - This is fundamental aspect of TDM that should be relevant for all WG.
* WG 2 - N/A
* WG 4 - Workflows can produce abstract representations that are a long way from the original text (relates to 
"copyright protects the expression of a fact, not the idea, not the fact itself"). They can also produce associations
that were never explicitly mentioned anywhere in any of the original data, i.e., produce new knowledge previously
unknown by anyone. That knowledge is derived, it could not have been found without the original data, but does it
constitute a derivative work?

==== Relevance in general

External experts combine expertise in the legal and technical field. Try to identify the limits in the scope of the
applicable legal tools is a fundamental element.

==== Approaches

* Correct labeling of the resources. With proper labeling, through the correct application of the licence and licence
metadata, a first set of problems can be solved.
* Correct use of licences. The convergence towards a de facto standard (e.g. CC variants) will reduce incompatibility
issues and transaction costs.
* ELC: proper exception to copyright and related rights (e.g. UK to some extent) can contribute to fix additional
access and reuse issues.
