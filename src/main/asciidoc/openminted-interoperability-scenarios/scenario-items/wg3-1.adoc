=== Scenario 1 -- Legal status of aggregations: focus on content

==== Description

Researcher A is conducting research on a variety of sources. He needs to extract statistical information
from 3 DB: X, Y and Z. He runs a TDM instance on the 3 databases and obtains insightful results. He wants to know how, if at all, he
can use the resulting output. Database X is made publicly available on the Internet by the right holder but is not
released under any specifically identified licence, term of use or any other policy. DB X is constituted by a text corpus
(i.e. the individual elements constituting the database are not individually copyrightable). 
Database Y is available online under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 license and is constituted by a DB of academic articles (i.e. the
elements constituting the database are individually copyrightable). Database Z is a “closed” database to which the
researcher has access thanks to the “academic subscription” of its institution which allows to TDM the database but only
for “academic and research activities and for non commercial purposes” and forbids the distribution or communication of
results for any purpose. All these activities are performed using tools and or services belonging to the researcher
(i.e. no licence or terms of use on tools and or services are relevant in this scenario).

==== Relevance to the WG

The scenario identifies the main elements of legal interoperability: absence of clear license or right statement, OA
publishing, closed databases, Exceptions and Limitations to Copyright. The scenario also considers the type of results
that TDM activities lead to (whether there is a redistribution of at least part of the original data).

==== Relevance to other WGs

* WG 1 - Are the licences or rights statements expressed in (machine-readable/processable) metadata?
* WG 2 - N/A
* WG 4 - License information and provenance information must be preserved throughout the workflow.

==== Relevance in general

External experts combine expertise in the legal and technical field. The combination of the three identified DB legal
conditions is the starting point to determine legal interoperability.

==== Approaches

* Correct labeling of the resources with information about the licence, and with relevant licence metadata. With proper
labeling, through the correct application of the licence and licence metadata, a first set of problems can be solved.
* Correct use of licences. The convergence towards a de facto standard (e.g. CCPL) will reduce incompatibility issues
and transaction costs.
* Exceptions and Limitations to Copyright: proper exception to copyright and related rights (e.g. UK to some extent)
can contribute to fix additional access and reuse issues.
